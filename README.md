Gimp script-fu 

Tilt Shift V0.8 creates the Tilt Shift effect to the lowest layer in the active image.

This script does not change the original image nor any settings within GIMP. Instead it creates two new layers each containing copies of the original image and applies the Gauss filter to achieve the Tilt shift effect. To undo this effect just deactivate or better delete theses new layers.
